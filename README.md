# Try it out!!

You want to try it out without any installation? YOU CAN! Just check out the [live version](https://my-eat-list.netlify.app/).

Just fire up [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) and make requests :D.

Although, give it a little time to fire up itself, it's hosted on a free heroku node, so it goes to sleep a lot <img src="https://i.imgur.com/3CUJMpz.png" width="50px">

# Development Setup

Steps: 
- Clone this repo:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:YoseptF/my-eat-list-backend.git
```
- Move to the lastest branch:
```
$ git checkout [branch name]
```
- Install the dependencies:
```
$ npm install
```
- Run the developer server: (this one is gonna be pretty important if you are running both front and backend, because by default rails and react try to use `localhost:3000`, so I configured the npm command to run this on `localhost:4000`)
```
$ npm start
```

And that's it. pretty easy uh?
